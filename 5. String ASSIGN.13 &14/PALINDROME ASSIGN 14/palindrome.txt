/*
A palindrome is a string that is same in both forward and backward reading.
Example:
   "madam"
   "racecar"
   "a man a plan a canal panama"
   "radar"
You will write a program that will test if a given string is a palingdrome or not.
Your program will ask the user to input a string and if the string is a palindrome program
will just print "Yes, it is a Palindrome", otherwise will print "No, not a Palindrome".

Please note that:
1. Your you need to check in case-insensitive way, that means: Madam or madam both should be
detected as Palindrome.

2. There can be (any number of ) spaces in between the words.
    "A man a plan a canal panama"
        OR
    "A     man    a   pla n a cana l Panama"
    both the strings must be detected as Palindrome.
3.There can be punctuations in between the words, for this assignments,
we consider only 4 punctuations,   . ?  ! and ,

Your program will just need to ignore them (treat them as space).
    "Cigar? Toss it in a can. It is so tragic."
    Should be detected as palindrome.

 *** For this assignment I will not write any instructions or guidance, you are free
        to implement it with your own way, you can use the string.h functions

    Good luck.

    int isPalindrome = 1;  // assign 0 to this if the string is a NOT palindrome
